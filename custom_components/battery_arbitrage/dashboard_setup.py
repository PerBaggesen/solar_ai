"""Auto-create the Solar AI Lovelace dashboard from the bundled YAML (v0.51.0).

HACS only copies the integration's own folder, so the dashboard YAML ships
inside `dashboards/` here. At setup (opt-in) the integration registers a
storage-mode Lovelace dashboard and writes the bundled config into it — the
same two steps the WebSocket commands `lovelace/dashboards/create` and
`lovelace/config/save` perform, done in-process.

Everything is wrapped so a failure can never stop the config entry from
loading; the user can always fall back to the manual import documented in the
README.
